# Chess Puzzles

The domain will be able to generate random chess puzzles with options for daily, random puzzles, or specifically themed puzzles.
A user will be able to view their puzzle statistics or review past puzzles within the current session of the program.
Users should have the option to log in or create an account [built into the lichess api].
If a user is logged in, they should be able to access any past puzzle scores or game histories they’ve played on that account

## Testing

The repo also includes an example of a use case interactor test, as well as
an example of an end-to-end test which automates button clicks and inspects
the contents of the actual views. This is something we discussed in the lectures
about testing in CA but had not provided a code example of before. Note, one
could also inspect the contents of the ViewModel objects instead when testing
CA to make a similar test which would be less dependent on the details of the
specific UI implementation.

## Project Starter Code

Your team may choose to use this repo as starter code for your project. You could
also use the lab 5 code — or start from an empty repo if your team prefers.

If you choose to use one of the repositories we have provided, you can either make
a fork of it or copy the subset of code you want into a completely new repository.
